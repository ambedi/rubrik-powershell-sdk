### ChatbotTimeRangeFilterInput
TimeRangeFilter allows for filtering based on whether a given time
 is within a time range. If start_time is 0, the beginning of the range
 is infinite. If end_time is 0, the end of the range is infinite.

- startTime: System.Int64
  - Start time of the time range.
- endTime: System.Int64
  - End time of the time range.
