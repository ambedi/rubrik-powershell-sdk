  - List of descendants.
- effectiveRetentionSlaDomain: SlaDomain
  - The effective Retention SLA Domain of the hierarchy object.
- effectiveSlaDomain: SlaDomain
  - The effective retention of the SLA Domain of the hierarchy object.
- effectiveSlaSourceObject: PathNode
  - The path node of the effective SLA Domain source.
