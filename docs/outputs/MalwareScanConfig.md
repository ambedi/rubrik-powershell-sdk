### MalwareScanConfig
Supported in v6.0+

- fileScanCriteria: MalwareScanFileCriteria
  - Supported in v6.0+
  Criteria to restrict files to scan.
- indicatorsOfCompromise: a list of CdmIndicatorOfCompromises
  - Required. Supported in v6.0+
  List of IOCs to scan for.
- maxMatchesPerSnapshot: System.Int32
  - Supported in v6.0+
  Maximum number of matches per shapshot, per IOC.  Scanning for an Indicator Of Compromise within a snapshot will terminate once this many matches have been detected. Defaults to one.
- name: System.String
  - Supported in v6.0+
  Name of this scan.
- notes: System.String
  - Supported in v6.0+
  Notes to describe this scan.
- objectIds: a list of System.Strings
  - Required. Supported in v6.0+
  Snappable IDs to scan for malware.
- requestedMatchDetails: RequestedMatchDetails
  - Supported in v6.0+
  Additional information required for files with malware matches.
- shouldTrustFilesystemTimeInfo: System.Boolean
  - Supported in v6.0+
  Specifies whether features that rely on the accuracy of filesystem metadata, like creation time and modification time of files, are enabled or not. These features include backend optimizations to skip re-scanning files that have not changed across snapshots, as indicated by the unchanged timestamps of files. This flag also gates access to some filters that can be specified in this API. Note that this flag should be used with caution, as relying on file timestamps may make the system vulnerable to adversarial techniques such as timestamp manipulation.
- snapshotScanLimit: MalwareScanSnapshotLimit
  - Supported in v6.0+
  Limit which snapshots to include in the malware scan.
